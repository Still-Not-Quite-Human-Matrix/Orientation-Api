## What You Will Be Learning

### ERD

Entity Relationship Diagrams are visual representations of your database structure, and relationships between data. You will build an ERD that represents the first version of your database.

### Attribute Routing

ASP.NET makes heavy use of [attribute routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2) to abstract away much of the heavy lifting that is required to build an API. By using these Magical Abstractions, far less coding and configuration is needed from an API developer.

### Models

You will define models, which are abstractions to the actual database. The model reflects the underlying table's columns and structure

### WebApi Controllers

You will learn about what role a controller has in an API, how it uses models and validates a request against the model, and returning data from your database to the internets.

### Use Dapper for Data Access

[Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/blob/master/Readme.md) is a Micro ORM that allows you to interact more directly with the database than Entity Framework, but still will map your query results into objects for you, saving you from a lot of ExecuteReader madness.  Use Dapper by taking a dependency on an IDbConnection and using the Dapper extension methods.

## Requirements

1. Create an empty Web API project.
1. Define tables, models and controllers for the following resources.
    1. Customer
    1. Order
    1. Product
    1. LineItem
1. Ensure that you have annotations on your models to verify the model is valid when it comes into the API.
1. Create repositories for data access.
